# LightPhoneBookWithValidation
A Light Phonebook which incorporates validation of attribute values using Content Providers.

This is a light weight Phonebook app that lets the user add just the Name and The Phone Number to create a new contact. The List of contacts is displayed in a ListView below.

The App also provides validation for user entered values. The App throws an alert when the user enters blank value for either Name or Phone Number.

The App aims to cut the hassle of going through a set of screens everytime a user wants to add a contact. The App communicates with the Contacts Content Provider on the phone for Contact Manipulation.

Sample - 
User enters a value in the text field given.
